# RetailMart Product Sales Prediction

The project predicts sales by product at a retail store based on the sales data of 559 products across 10 stores.

It demonstrates the key steps involved in any data analytics project including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data wrangling, training base model(s), model evaluation, selection, tuning, model serialization, and prediction using the finalized model. Further, in this project, I have demonstrated how custom transformers can be defined and chained using pipeline(s) making it easy to apply the same set of transformations to any new data. Total eight base models - Linear Regression, ElasticNet , Lasso, Support Vector Regression, KNeighbours Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression were developed. THe Lasso regression model was selected and fine tuned.
