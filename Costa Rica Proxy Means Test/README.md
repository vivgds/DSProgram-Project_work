# Proxy means test (PMT)

Many social programs have a hard time ensuring that the right people are given enough aid. It’s tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. This segment of the population can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.

In Costa Rica, a popular method called the Proxy Means Test (PMT) uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling or the assets found in their homes to classify them and predict their level of need.

While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) believes that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT’s performance.

The project develops a high-performing Random Forest Classifier model to classify families correctly if they qualify for aid or not. A XGBoost Classifier was also developed can compared to Random Forest model. It is worth mentioning the project is an excellent exercise in using Pandas for data wrangling.
